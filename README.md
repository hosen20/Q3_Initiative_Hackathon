# N2H2 Gap Energy Calculation

Diazene (N₂H₂) is a key intermediate in the multi-step reduction of dinitrogen (N₂) to ammonia (NH₃), appearing after initial proton-coupled electron transfers and before further hydrogenation to hydrazine and ammonia2. Determining its gap energy—the difference between ground and first excited states—helps identify photocatalysts capable of efficiently driving these transformations under light, optimizing energy input and reaction selectivity.

80% of ammonia produces per year is used in the production of fertilizers. By building better photocatalysts, the production rate of ammonia becomes faster and more efficient.

Two algorithms (QSE & SS-VQE) are implemented to find the ground and first excited states energies of a simple H2 molecule. Then QSE is used to find this gap energy of a more complex molecule Diazene N2H2.
